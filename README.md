# UniStock

This is a demo APP build in Flutter and MS SQL Server is used for databse, by this app we can maintain Unimart Inventory by Scanning Barcode of products and adding quantity of this product. Here, two modes are used, one is adding product to the stock by just scanning the product's Barcode one by one and the quantity of the product will be updated automatically. Another one is adding product quantity manually, here after scanning a pop up screen will be showed with the product details then we need to input the quantity to be added in the stock.
